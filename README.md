### More about me and my skillset

I am a second year computer science student at Toronto Metropolitan University, and have a goal of becoming a software developer. I have programmed for several years starting in high school and have worked with several coding languages, frameworks, and more. Some of my personal projects can be seen on here and I continue to learn and create more.
